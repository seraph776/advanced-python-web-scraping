# ‚àû Infinite Scroll

Nowadays, more and more websites start to use `infinite scrolling` to replace the classic pagination. In reality, there is a pagination in an infinite scrolling page, but it is hidden in the HTML code. On a classic page, the user clicks on the next page URL whereas here, the next page is called dynamically when you visit the end area of the webpage. When user scroll to the bottom of the web pages, javascript will send HTTP request and load new items automatically. You can see `infinite scrolling` in most e-commerce website and blogs.


## Analyze the Web Page


First, visit [Quotes to Scrape - Infinite Scroll](https://quotes.toscrape.com/scroll). Open the `Developer Tools`  of our browser to help inspect the web traffic of the website. Then go to `Network` tab, and make sure `Disable Cache`, `Persisit Logs`,  and  `XHR` is selected.

> üëâ **Note**: the requests we‚Äôre interested in will be in the XHR filter.

You can see all real time requests the browser is making. As you scroll down, you can see the requests pop up in the panel. You need to find the URL that javascript used to get the data. When you select a request, you can see its information such as `URL`, `HTTP method`, and `headers`.

You can also see the data is structured within a `json` reposnse object.

## Requests API endpoint

Make a requests to the URL that the javascript is requesting, and extract the data using a `json` parser. 


```python
from requests_html import HTMLSession

session = HTMLSession()

url = 'http://quotes.toscrape.com/api/quotes?page=2'

page = session.get(url)
print(page.json())

## Load JSON string into a Dictionary

Use `json.loads` to load the json `response` string into a `diction` object:

```python
from requests_html import HTMLSession

session = HTMLSession()

url = 'http://quotes.toscrape.com/api/quotes?page=2'

page = session.get(url)
json_obj = json.loads(page.text)

data = json_obj.keys()
print(data) 

# dict_keys(['has_next', 'page', 'quotes', 'tag', 'top_ten_tags'])
```

Lets start by reading the quotes:

```python
print(data['quotes'])

# [{'author': {'goodreads_link': '/author/show/82952.Marilyn_Monroe', 'name': 'Marilyn Monroe', 'slug': 'Marilyn-Monroe'}, 'tags': ['friends', 'heartbreak', 'inspirational', 'life', 'love', 'sisters'], 'text': "‚ÄúThis life is what you make it.
