## ☤ Legality of Web Scraping

The Legality of web scraping is totally dependent on the legal jurisdiction i.e. Laws are country and locality specific. Publicly available information gathering or scraping is not illegal, if it were illegal, Google would not exist as a company because they scrape data from every website in the world.


- **United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit - (LinkedIn v.  HiQ Labs (2022))** - The decision echoes the appeal’s court 2019 decision, which upheld a lower court’s 2017 determination in HiQ v. LinkedIn that web scraping doesn’t qualify as accessing a protected computer without authorization.

- **The US Supreme Court - (Van Buren v.  United States (2021))** - This case does not directly address web scraping, but it does touch upon the use of Computer Fraud and Abuse Act enacted in 1986 (CFAA) in the cases of webscraping. A good commentary about this case can be read here.

It is a complex case that may not answer all questions related to CFAA but it does seem to narrow down the scope of the CFAA considerably, which should serve as a deterrent to companies that rely on the CFAA to target webscraping.


- **Eastern District Court of New York - (Genius Media Group Inc vs Google LLC and Lyricfind (2020))** - Google, arguably the world’s largest scraping company, had a web scraping case against them dismissed by Judge Margo Brodie. Google had repeatedly scraped lyrics from Genius to show up in their search results and the Judge dismissed the lawsuit stating

- **US District Court for The District Of Columbia - (Sandvig v Sessions (2018))** - A US District court ruling  (Sandvig v Sessions) that talks directly about web scraping states:

> scraping plausibly falls within the ambit of the First Amendment.

and

> That plaintiffs wish to scrape data from websites rather than manually record information does not change the analysis. Scraping is merely a technological advance that makes information collection easier; it is not meaningfully different from using a tape recorder instead of taking written notes, or using the panorama function on a smartphone instead of taking a series of photos from different positions.

- **US District Court for The District Of Columbia - (Sandvig v Sessions (2020))** - US District Court in Washington, DC, has ruled that violating a website’s terms of service isn’t a crime under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act US District Judge John D. Bates in Sandvig v Barr (Civil Action No. 16-1368) said,

> Criminalizing terms-of-service violations risks turning each website into its own criminal jurisdiction and each webmaster into his own legislature. Such an arrangement, wherein each website’s terms of service “is a law unto itself“, would raise serious problems.


- **US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit - (Oracle vs Rimini Street (2018))**

> "Taking data using a method prohibited by the applicable terms of use" — i.e., scraping —
when the taking itself generally is permitted, does not violate” the state computer crime laws.

>  “As EFF puts it, ‘[n]either statute . . . applies to bare violations of a website’s terms of use—such as when a computer user has permission and authorization to access and use the computer or data at issue, but simply accesses or uses the information in a manner the website owner does not like.’”
